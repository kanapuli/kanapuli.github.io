Hello ! I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://hellofresh.com/">Hellofresh</a>, Berlin. My daily routine involves building platform services and tooling around Kafka and RabbitMQ to keep the Asynchronous Communications inside the company alive. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://exotel.com/">Exotel</a>, India where I architected the Kubernetes infrastructure and built backend services to power millions of telephone calls and SMS-es everyday. I am Gopher at work and a Rust fanboy at home. Occasionally, I write about things I find interesting.</span>
